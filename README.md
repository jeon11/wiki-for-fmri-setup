# wiki-for-fmri-setup

For sharing wiki page of fMRI setup for 3TA in VUIIS (ported just the wiki page from private repo)

[See Full Wiki Here](https://github.com/jeon11/wiki-for-fmri-setup/wiki/Setting-fMRI-3TA)

Sample audio files description:
include 4 types of files that are generated from a single functional run:
Main, main_ref, DSP_OUT, and TTL. See [here](https://github.com/jeon11/wiki-for-fmri-setup/wiki/Setting-fMRI-3TA#resulted-files) for full description

- All the audio files' names are saved with a tag the time they were saved, but in the sample data, I changed the time to 00:00:00 to make the data anonymous as possible.
- The four files all have the same duration (6 min 17 seconds) as they are just 4 different types of sound from same duration.
- Starting ~4:30, you can start hearing them speak the stimuli that were presented during the study period.
